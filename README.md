# Learning Controllable Embeddings

> Code originally from Mohammad, Ge is trying to use this code to build something new.

## ToDo
- [ ] model

## Environments

**`Pole`**, **`CartPole`**, and **`Plane`**
> **`Arm`** environment is currently missing code.

- run [./run_interactive_sim.py](./run_interactive_sim.py) to see what the simulation is doing.
- run [./generate_plane_data.py](./generate_plane_data.py) to make the datafiles, inside [./datasets](./datasets)
- run [./what_is_data.py](./what_is_data.py) to visualize the datasets.
